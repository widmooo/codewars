// Easy wallpaper

// John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He has been said that making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds. He wants a fool-proof method to getting it right.

// John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

// Last time he did these calculations he caught a headache so could you help John? Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

// #Example: wallpaper(4, 3.5, 3) should return "ten"

// #Notes:

// all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
// 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that w x h x l is zero
// the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20

function wallpaper(l, w, h) {
  const numberWords = [
    "zero",
    "one",
    "two",
    "three",
    "four",
    "five",
    "six",
    "seven",
    "eight",
    "nine",
    "ten",
    "eleven",
    "twelve",
    "thirteen",
    "fourteen",
    "fifteen",
    "sixteen",
    "seventeen",
    "eighteen",
    "nineteen",
    "twenty"
  ];
  const powRoll = 0.52 * 10;
  if ([l, w, h].indexOf(0) >= 0) {
    return "zero";
  }
  const count = l * h * 2 + w * h * 2;
  const result = (count / powRoll) * 1.15;
  const ceilResult = Math.ceil(result);
  const finalResult = numberWords[ceilResult];
  return finalResult;
}
